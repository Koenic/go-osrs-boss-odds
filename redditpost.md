Calculating the exact completion rates of bosses is a bit of a passion project of mine. Since I wanted to try out GoLang and a lot of new bosses have been reworked since I last did this I figured I would make a new album of expected rates.

## How to interpret these graphs

The blue lines show the odds of completing the drops at or before that kc. At the Kc where the blue line is at .5 is the median. At that point half of the players is expected to have completed the drops.  
A lot of players consider themselves lucky if they get a drop before the droprate, which luckily for them most of them will. Since there are higher odds of you getting all the drops before you hit the droprate. I've marked the effective combined drop rates or the mean in the graphs where it wouldn't clutter the results.  
The red line shows the odds of a player completing the drops at a given kc. At it's peak is the mode which show the kc 'most' of the players will complete the boss at. If the red arc is narrower it means there is less variance in people completing the boss. In contrast if it's wide it is more likely to go very unlucky.

## Project Rebalance

Project rebalance proposes new drop rates for both variants of the nightmare, but does not mention altering pet drops, in order to compare the proposed changes to the current variants I think It's more fair to compare without the pets.
